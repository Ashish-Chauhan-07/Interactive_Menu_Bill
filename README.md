-	Kindly choose the tip% you'd be providing us with: 1/2/3
    - 1 -> 0%
    - 2 -> 10%
    - 3 -> 20%
-   Enter the number of people, among which bill is to be split: Some whole number(to make sense).
-   Enter 'Y' to participate and 'N' to loose by not participating : Y/N
    - Y -> Participate in event (Discount/Increase based on luck)
    - N -> Don't participate (Discount=0 & Increase=0)
-   Breakdown of the bill will be displayed with required details.

The additional functionalities of this assignment are made in a very user friendly way, guiding the user at every step.
First we need to run the app.py then client.py. Further steps will be given to client as and when required. 
Try to enter the desired input required. Rest should work fine.
